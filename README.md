# PatchMatch
This is an attempt to write the Patch Match Algorithm on Python
the Algorithm is being implemented with this topic in mind: Creation of Synthetic CT images for Radiotherapy usage

Ref: https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Barnes_2009_PAR/patchmatch.pdf

for now the code is optimized to be used using MATLAB data/matrix as an image data. 
in the future, it will be implemented with a DICOM-data, so it can be used universally
